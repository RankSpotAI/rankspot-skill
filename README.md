# RankSpot SEO Skill

Programmatic SEO and AI visibility for agents. See how ChatGPT, Perplexity and Google answer questions about your brand, track competitors, score keywords, analyse backlinks, mine "People Also Ask" questions, plan work as actions, and generate articles, all through the RankSpot API.

## Install

```bash
npx skills add RankSpotAI/rankspot-skill --skill rankspot
```

Then set your API key (get it from **Account settings, then API Keys** in the [RankSpot dashboard](https://rankspot.ai)) and the workspace to work on:

```bash
export RANKSPOT_API_KEY=your_key_here

# A key acts as you and reaches every workspace you belong to; pick one
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $RANKSPOT_API_KEY" \
  https://api.rankspot.ai/v1/workspaces | jq '.[] | {id, name, organization: .organization.name}'
export RANKSPOT_WORKSPACE_ID=the_id_you_picked
```

No other dependencies. The skill uses `curl` and `jq`.

## AI Visibility

RankSpot asks your tracked prompts on ChatGPT, Perplexity, Google AI Overview and Google AI Mode on a daily schedule, then analyses the answers.

| Score            | What it measures                                                     |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `visibilityScore`| Share of answers that named your brand, as a mean across platforms    |
| `shareOfVoice`   | Your mentions as a share of all brand mentions                        |
| `citationShare`  | Citations pointing at your domain as a share of all citations         |
| `categoryRank`   | Your position in the brand leaderboard                                |

Every score is nullable, and null means no data in the period, never zero. Check `responsesCounted` before quoting any of them. There is no built-in period comparison: call the summary twice with two periods of equal length.

List endpoints take optional `startDate` and `endDate` as `YYYY-MM-DD`. Omit both for the full history.

## Actions

An action is one piece of planned work. Its `type` decides which target it needs:

| Type                                        | Required target |
|---------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| `write_article`, `add_prompt`, `other`      | none            |
| `update_article`, `publish_article`, `request_indexing` | `articleId` |
| `earn_link`                                 | `backlinkId`    |
| `get_cited`, `reply_thread`, `record_video` | `citationId`    |
| `track_competitor`                          | `competitorId`  |

Only `write_article` produces an article, via `POST /actions/:id/generate`. Closing an action marks the citation or backlink behind it handled, and reopening it puts that evidence back on the worklist.

## Keyword Scoring

RankSpot enriches each keyword with several signals. Sort by the one that fits your goal:

| Signal             | Description                                                      |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `compositeScore`   | Weighted blend of opportunity and AI relevance (best default sort) |
| `opportunityIndex` | High volume plus low competition                                  |
| `aiScore`          | Relevance to your specific business                               |
| `searchVolume`     | Monthly search volume                                             |
| `competitionIndex` | 0 to 100 competition level                                        |

## Backlink Analysis

```bash
# Competitor backlinks filtered to a specific domain
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $RANKSPOT_API_KEY" \
  "https://api.rankspot.ai/v1/workspaces/$RANKSPOT_WORKSPACE_ID/backlinks?type=competitors&domainFrom=producthunt" | jq .

# Your own backlinks
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $RANKSPOT_API_KEY" \
  "https://api.rankspot.ai/v1/workspaces/$RANKSPOT_WORKSPACE_ID/backlinks?type=mine" | jq .
```

Each row is a referring domain with `domainFromRank`, `competitorCount`, `linksToYou`, `firstSeen` and `links[]`: one link per target (`competitor: null` is you) with `urlFrom`, `anchor`, `dofollow` and `backlinkSpamScore`.
